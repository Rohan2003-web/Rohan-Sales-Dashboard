# Rohan-Sales-Dashboard
I've recently learned Power BI and created a sample Sales Dashboard 

Here's what I accomplished:

Data Integration: Imported and transformed raw data to ensure a comprehensive dataset using power query editor.

Visualizations: Created interactive charts and graphs to visualize sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

Insights: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to track important metrics like revenue growth, average order value.

Forecasting: Implemented forecasting models to predict future sales trends.

Power BI has proven to be an incredibly powerful tool for turning data into actionable insights. I will continue exploring its capabilities and applying them to drive business success.
